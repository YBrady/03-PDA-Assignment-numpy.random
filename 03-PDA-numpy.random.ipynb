    "Numpy is one of the core packages used in data analytics on the Python platform. It comprises a series of functions and methods that allow for easier data storage, retrieval and manipulation. It is centered on arrays, which are in essence what each dataset is made up of.  \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy has been around since 2005, when Travis Oliphant managed to merge the previously two competing numerical packagesin Python, Numeric and NumArray,  into one package, NumPy. It is a contraction of the phrease Numerical Python and is the basis of most if not all Python packages with scientific functionality.  \n",
    "  \n",

    "* ndarray - a multidimensional array  \n",
    "* functions - that perform mathematical operations quickly and efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy library of algorithms is written in the C language, a compiled rather than interpreted language which allows faster processing times. Its operations make it possible to perform complex calculations on entire arrays without the need for looping through each element in Python. NumPy algorithms are generally at least 10 to 100 times faster than their Python scripted alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is an external package that must be imported into python for use. Convention has it that it is imported as \"np\". Each numpy function etc can then be called by prefacing it with np."
