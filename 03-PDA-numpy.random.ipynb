    "NumPy has been around since 2005, when Travis Oliphant managed to merge the previously two competing numerical packagesin Python, Numeric and NumArray,  into one package, NumPy. It is a contraction of the phrease Numerical Python and is the basis of most if not all Python packages with scientific functionality.  \n",

    "NumPy library of algorithms is written in the C language, a compiled rather than interpreted language which allows faster processing times. Its operations make it possible to perform complex calculations on entire arrays without the need for looping through each element in Python. NumPy algorithms are generally at least 10 to 100 times faster than their Python scripted alternatives.\n",

    "NumPy is an external package that must be imported into python for use. Convention has it that it is imported as \"np\". Each numpy function etc can then be called by prefacing it with np."

This means that if you are looking for a number between 1 and 10 you need to specify that the low is 1 and the high is 11. If no high value is specified, the low value entered in fact acts as the high value and the low value is defaulted to 0. Interestingly enough, although the output is an or multiple integers, the low and high limits may be entered as floating point numbers.  \n",
