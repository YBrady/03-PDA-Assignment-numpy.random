**Warning:**  
* When running like this the notebook will NOT go to completion.  
* It pauses at the start to get you to pick a number between 1 and 10. (There is no error handling on this if you ener in a number outside these limits or anything but a number.)  
* It is designed to error at some parts which will become evident as you look through the Notebook. Intentional errors are clearly marked.
